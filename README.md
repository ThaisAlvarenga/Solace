# Solace
Capstone Project for my undergrad at NYUAD. 

## Description
Solace is an immersive virtual reality (VR) experience that explores narrative devices in a virtual environment. The experience consists of a 360°circular track on which the user navigates through the environment. While the user moves along this track, the story begins to unfold through a combination of 3D and 2D animations.
